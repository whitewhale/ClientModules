This private module is designed to demonstrate how to add an additional custom field to a backend editor. It adds several custom fields (one for each type) to the event editor for demonstration purposes.

Instructions:

- After installation on your dev server, you will immediately see the new custom fields added to the events editor.
- Does not require any additional changes. However, to display the custom fields in your event details page or calendar template you must add a variable for each custom field (custom_my_field_name1, custom_my_field_name2, etc.)

Requires: 1.6.1+

Note: Functionality expected to be incorporated into LiveWhale core in a future version of the CMS.

***

The public module is optional and demonstrates how you might also want to expose custom fields to a static web page according to some logic. In this example, custom template variables are set according to the group owner of a particular page.
