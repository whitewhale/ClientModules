This module adds form grading options to LiveWhale forms.

Instructions:

- Once module is installed, edit any form.
- Click the checkbox for grading in the sidebar.
- For each form element, enter the relevant grading information.
- After configuring the form elements, enter any relevant settings into the grading section.
