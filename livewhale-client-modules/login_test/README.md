This module allows an admin to preview alternate login mode settings (such as trying an SSO implementation intended to replace passwords) without impacting active logins on the instance for other users.

Instructions:

- Configure the "custom" settings below to provide what config settings should be overrided when toggling on the overrides for your user.
- Use /livewhale/?login&login_toggle=1 to toggle back and forth between override settings.

Requirement: LiveWhale CMS/Calendar 1.6.2+.
