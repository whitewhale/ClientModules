This module allows for a front-end listing of all live Linked Calendars.

Instructions:

- After installing, choose which page you want to display linked calendars on.
- Update the page_path variable in the module to /my-page/index.php
- Then, on /my-page/index.php, add <xphp var="linked_calendars"/> to the source code

This will display a bulleted list of all active linked calendars, with additional information about the group it's in, and what types/tags are being added to its events automatically.
